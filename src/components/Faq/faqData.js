  {
    q: "What are Postural Modifications if you have a knee pain?",
    a: "Not to sit cross legged\nNot to squat\nAvoid climbing stairs."
  },
  {
    q: "Walking stick should be taken in which hand?",
    a: "Stick is to be taken in opposite side as it increases efficiency of load transmission by liver arm mechanism."
  },
  {
    q: "Braces or knee cap.. Which is better?",
    a: "Braces are preferred as they are stronger and more efficient."
  },
  {
    q: "Exercise.. does it help you if yes how?",
    a: "Yes, exercise helps by making muscles flexible and stronger.\nMore useful exercises are walking, cycling without resistance, swimming."
  },
  {
    q: "What else can be done for knee arthritis besides surgery?",
    a: "Exercises, physiotherapy and gel injection…but their outcome is not predictable."
  },
  {
    q: "Injection into knee …What, Why, When, Is it of use…",
    a: "3 types of injections are available\n1. Steroid – instant relief for short duration.\n2. Hyaluronic acid – Early-stage Osteoarthritis or severe arthritis for those who are medically unfit or want to delay surgery for short duration.\n3. Platelet rich plasma – Early-stage Osteoarthritis. It has advantage of partially reversing the process of degeneration and helping for cartilage regeneration."
  },
  {
    q: "Should I wait as long as possible for replacement?",
    a: "Osteoarthritis is progressive process\nUnnecessary waiting damages joint surface more, deforms bones, restricts movement, makes surgery technically more difficult for surgeon.\nPatients’ health deteriorates overtime and likelihood of surgery related complications.\nIn some scenario severely damaged joint may not be repairable with routine implants and may need more advanced and expensive implants that is with rods and hinge.\nWith age increasing osteoporosis compromise the hold of implant reducing the survivorship"
  },
  {
    q: "Should I continue with medication as long as possible",

    q: "Alternative therapies like Acupressure, Ozone, Magnetic, Laser may cure my advanced arthritis and knee pain",
    a: "There is no scientifically proven permanent non-surgical cure on advanced osteoarthritis; theses all work for temporary relief in early to moderate arthritis. It is observed that many people end up with trying these therapies as they are fearful of uncertainty of surgery. This delays surgery but cannot avoid."
  },
  {
    q: "Am I too old for surgery / Am I too young",
    a: "Age is no age bar as earliest TKR we had done was for 45 yrs old female of rheumatoid arthritis and oldest patient was of 90 yrs who had age related arthritis.\nAge is not contraindication for surgery, if clinically fit he/she can undergo the procedure after fitness from anesthesia and physician.\nWe may do total knee replacement in young patients. This requires in post-traumatic and rheumatoid arthritis patient. However, they need to avoid contact sports for increasing the longevity of implants."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know if knee replacement surgery will help me?",

  },
  {
    q: "Total Knee Replacement is very painful surgery ..there is lot of pain in postoperative period",
    a: "Modern day approach such as multimodal medications, nerve blocks, and local tissue infiltration have made surgery relatively pain free and friendly."
  },
  {
    q: "After surgery .. I will have to give up some activities and sports?",

  },
  {
    q: "Driving is not possible after replacement?",
    a: "It is lot easier and more possible after 8weeks"
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to make a complete recovery?",
    a: "In 24 to 48 hrs patients walk, and become independent for toilet\nIn 3 weeks almost all start staircase climbing and social activities.\nKitchen activity for females possible after 4 weeks.\nRecovery is a gradual process. Walking and physical therapy exercises will help speed your recovery.\nMost patients are able to participate in most daily activities till 6 weeks.\nMost joint replacement patients have regained the strength and endurance they had before surgery till 3 months.\nMost patients can expect full recovery till 6 months, depending on the type of surgery and your overall health and the success of your rehabilitation."
  },
  {
    q: "Surgery is done one at a time",
    a: "If cardio pulmonary status is okay and blood loss acceptable after one leg knee replacement.\nIf anesthesia team permits other side knee replacement can be done at same stage.\nOr else it is preferable after 6 to 12 weeks."
  },
  {
    q: "Are there any advantage of doing replacement in both knees at same time?",
    a: "If we have pain relief in both knees earliest, gait improvement and walking will be better.\nAs well as anesthesia drug requirement, stay and cost of surgery is reduced by almost 40 percent if both side replacement id done in single stage."
  },
  {
    q: "Implants work only for 10years",
    a: "Precision of surgery, advancement in biomaterials, today’s knee last for around 20 years or longer and is lifetime for most. Studies have demonstrated that 85% of the knee implants placed 20 years ago are still functioning well. With significant improvements made in implant materials and surgical techniques, today’s knee implants will probably last much longer."
  },
  {
    q: "I am obese ,I cannot undergo knee replacement",
    a: "It can be successfully done in obese. Evidence suggest comparable results, but these cases need more expertise and special techniques. Some people wait to reduce weight but lose weight better after replacement. Evidence says that if weight more than 130kg then do the bariatric surgery first."
  },
  {
    q: "I have diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases ,so I cannot undergo surgery?",
    a: "These conditions are no bar. Detail checkup is routine, and treated patients are better candidates for surgery. These diseases do not affect outcome but cautions needed. One can gain better health after surgery."
  },
  {
    q: "Is it like the kidney or liver replacement and my whole knee is removed and new put?",
    a: "No, whole knee is never replaced. Only worn-out part is removed and replaced by artificial ones. So technically it is more like resurfacing rather than replacement."
  },
  {
    q: "I will choose my implant from google?",
    a: "There are various designs and company of implants, many are good. Different surgeons use different company, so better to choose surgeon and leave it upon him to choose implant."
  },
  {
    q: "Expensive implants are always better. Only expensive implants give good results?",
    a: "There is reliable data to support that they are indeed superior. Indian and imported both are good but results don’t depend only on implants. Results depend on post operative care, physiotherapy and technique."
  },
  {
    q: "Computer navigation is of no use?",
    a: "There is evidence that computer navigation is marginally better than conventional for overall alignment."
  },
  {
    q: "Knee replacement cannot be done second time?",
    a: "In an unfortunate event, knee replacement can be done again, it is called revision surgery and it has good survivorship."
  },
  {
    q: "My body may reject implants as they are foreign bodies?",
    a: "These are biocompatible implants. They are inert and don’t give allergic reactions to body."
  },
  {
    q: "This surgery has high risk and fails most of the times?",
    a: "The only risk in the entire surgery is the risk of infection. This risk is around 2%. Research also showed that knee replacement surgery has 95% success rate in most patients."
  },
  {
    q: "I will need lots of physiotherapy after the surgery and recovery is very slow?",
    a: "99% patients do not need a physiotherapist at home. All exercises are taught in hospital. 98% patients are walking without an aid after 4 weeks."

  },
  {
    q: "WHAT MEDICATIONS WILL BE PRESCRIBED AFTER SURGERY?",
    a: "Pain relievers will be prescribed after surgery. These are typically taken less than 7-10 days after surgery. The pain medication will not completely prevent any pain. It is normal and appropriate to have some pain after surgery. The goal of using medication should be to make pain tolerable, not to have no pain. We also need antibiotic for first 3 to days. Certain medications are given to promote healing and immunity"

Usually, doctor ask for review every three weeks"
  },
  {
    q: "HOW MUCH PAIN AM I GOING TO HAVE AFTER SURGERY?",
    a: "This is a common question, but one that is very difficult to answer. Every patient experiences pain differently. The same procedure may cause drastically different amounts of pain in different patients. Key components of controlling pain after surgery include icing the shoulder, taking appropriate pain medications, limiting activity appropriately, and following recommendations by the physical therapist. A nerve block is often placed by the anesthesia team during surgery. This block often works for several hours after surgery. As a result, your pain may be well controlled initially, but may increase after the block wears off. This is a normal part of the block wearing off, and shouldn’t be cause for concern in most cases. When you start to feel tingling in the arm, this is an indication that the block is beginning to wear off. This is a good time to begin taking pain medication."

  },
  {
    q: "If pain remains for few weeks after surgery, is it worrisome?",
    a: "Even though there are only a few small incisions, there was a significant amount of work that was done inside the Shoulder. The Shoulder can be stiff and sore for several weeks and you can expect some discomfort. Please do not judge the effectiveness of the surgery until after you have given yourself ample time to recover from the surgery. This may be at least 12 to 16 weeks after the surgery"

    a: "Link Indication shoulder arthroscopy"
  },
  {
    q: "WILL I NEED TO USE A SLING AFTER SURGERY?",
    a: "Yes. A particular type of sling is typically recommended (and provided in clinic prior to surgery) for protection for approximately 4-6 weeks after surgery. Doctor recommends that you wear the sling at all times after surgery. You are encouraged to come out of the sling several times per day and move the elbow/hand/wrist to prevent them from becoming stiff. You may remove the sling to shower according to your post-op instruction sheet. The sling is a good reminder for you to be careful with the shoulder after surgery. It is also a signal to those around you to be careful, so it is especially important to wear your sling at work/school and in crowds. You will not be allowed to lift any significant weight (nothing more than 2-5 pounds) with the surgical arm for approximately 4-6 weeks after surgery. You may use the arm to perform some basic activities of daily living such as eating, hygiene and working at a computer."
  },
  {
    q: "HOW LONG IS THE RECOVERY AFTER SHOULDER ARTHROSCOPIC ROTATOR CUFF REPAIR?",
    a: "It depends on the procedure performed. Most patients will need to wear their sling for approximately 4-6 weeks after surgery. Most patients can return to sedentary work around 1-2 weeks after surgery. More strenuous work may require more time to return, depending on the duties of your job profile. With strenuous jobs, it can take 6 months or more to return. Many patients are able to return to limited or light duty 3 weeks after surgery. Most patients return to sports activity around 9 to 12 months after surgery. Return to sports activities takes time and should not be rushed."
  },
  {
    q: "WILL PHYSICAL THERAPY BE NEEDED AFTER SHOULDER ARTHROSCOPy?",
    a: "Physical therapy is HIGHLY recommended after shoulder arthroscopic repair. Therapy begins three weeks after surgery to allow the repaired tissue to begin healing. Therapy starts with simple stretching exercises and progresses to strengthening. Duration varies and may last several months. Initially visits are twice per week. Recovery rate differs between patients and this is normal. Home exercises are important. Therapist assessment is crucial before returning to sports or work."

  },
  {
    q: "WILL I BE ABLE RETURN TO THE SAME ACTIVITIES AFTER SURGERY THAT I WAS DOING BEFORE SURGERY?",
    a: "In most cases, yes. This depends on age, activity level and sport. Goal of surgery is to restore shoulder function. Some patients may have pain, stiffness or fear of reinjury that limits return."
  },
  {
    q: "WILL I GET ARTHRITIS IN MY SHOULDER?",
    a: "Maybe. Surgery corrects shoulder structure but prior damage can lead to arthritis. Chances are very low and long term and less worrisome."

  },
  {
    q: "Can I sit cross legged or use Indian toilets after hip replacement surgery?",
    a: "Many can manage to sit cross legged or use Indian toilets but it is not safe. Even if you can do, it puts excessive load on hip joint that causes early arthritis or early loosening of implant and decreases the shelf life of new replaced joint. So preferable to avoid."
  },
  {
    q: "Is prolonged sitting painful after hip Replacement?",
    a: "No, but it is advisable to take frequent breaks in between as muscles do not become fatigued or stiff after prolonged sitting."

],
kneeArthroscopy: [
  {
    q: "Knee is loosened while walking. Is it ligament tear?",
    a: "In absence of injury/trauma, it may be due to muscle weakness. You need to focus on Physiotherapy. Make the muscles strong.\nIf you have a injury or trauma then you have to investigate [MRI] and confirm that you do not have ligament tear."
  },
  {
    q: "If Ligament is torn, is it possible to reform it as original?",
    a: "Certain ligaments in body like MCL and LCL may have capacity to regenerate. If other ligaments like ACL and PCL that are within the joint [intraarticular] get torn with Grade 3 that is complete tear then they do not unite. It requires arthroscopic repair."
  },
  {
    q: "Do knee work normally if meniscus is removed for any reason?",
    a: "Yes, you can walk normally, knee can work normally if meniscus is removed. But meniscus act as cushion in knee joint so it is removed, risk of early arthritis increases. So to prevent it, you need to maintain diet, weight and do regular exercises."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I play again or climbed stairs or do trekking after ligament/meniscus repair?",
    a: "Yes, after ligament/meniscus surgery, after couple of months when your rehabilitation program is done, you have done a good physiotherapy, your muscles are good, then you can think to restart your sport or trekking. This usually take one to one and half yr after index surgery."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I sit cross legged or use Indian toilet after ligament/meniscus repair?",
    a: "Yes, after 9mths to 1yr. If it is done before that it can cause twisting of repaired structure and does not seem to be safe, as getting up from these positions are actions against gravity and puts excessive weight on joint, so not advisable before 9mths to 1yr. [Duration may get prolonged depending on individual condition]."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I sit for a long or travel long distance after ligament/meniscus repair?",
