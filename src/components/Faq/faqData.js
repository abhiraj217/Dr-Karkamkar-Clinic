  {
    q: "Injection into knee …What, Why, When, Is it of use…",
    a: "3 types of injections are available\n1. Steroid – instant relief for short duration.\n2. Hyaluronic acid – Early-stage Osteoarthritis or severe arthritis for those who are medically unfit or want to delay surgery for short duration.\n3. Platelet rich plasma – Early-stage Osteoarthritis. It has advantage of partially reversing the process of degeneration and helping for cartilage regeneration."
  },
  {
    q: "Should I wait as long as possible for replacement?",
    a: "Osteoarthritis is progressive process\nUnnecessary waiting damages joint surface more, deforms bones, restricts movement, makes surgery technically more difficult for surgeon.\nPatients’ health deteriorates overtime and likelihood of surgery related complications.\nIn some scenario severely damaged joint may not be repairable with routine implants and may need more advanced and expensive implants that is with rods and hinge.\nWith age increasing osteoporosis compromise the hold of implant reducing the survivorship"
  },

    a: "In 24 to 48 hrs patients walk, and become independent for toilet\nIn 3 weeks almost all start staircase climbing and social activities.\nKitchen activity for females possible after 4 weeks.\nRecovery is a gradual process. Walking and physical therapy exercises will help speed your recovery.\nMost patients are able to participate in most daily activities till 6 weeks.\nMost joint replacement patients have regained the strength and endurance they had before surgery till 3 months.\nMost patients can expect full recovery till 6 months, depending on the type of surgery and your overall health and the success of your rehabilitation."
  },
  {
    q: "Surgery is done one at a time",
    a: "If cardio pulmonary status is okay and blood loss acceptable after one leg knee replacement.\nIf anesthesia team permits other side knee replacement can be done at same stage.\nOr else it is preferable after 6 to 12 weeks."
  },
  {
    q: "Are there any advantage of doing replacement in both knees at same time?",
    a: "If we have pain relief in both knees earliest, gait improvement and walking will be better.\nAs well as anesthesia drug requirement, stay and cost of surgery is reduced by almost 40 percent if both side replacement id done in single stage."
  },
  {
    q: "Implants work only for 10years",
    a: "Precision of surgery, advancement in biomaterials, today’s knee last for around 20 years or longer and is lifetime for most. Studies have demonstrated that 85% of the knee implants placed 20 years ago are still functioning well. With significant improvements made in implant materials and surgical techniques, today’s knee implants will probably last much longer."
  },
  {
    q: "I am obese ,I cannot undergo knee replacement",
    a: "It can be successfully done in obese. Evidence suggest comparable results, but these cases need more expertise and special techniques. Some people wait to reduce weight but lose weight better after replacement. Evidence says that if weight more than 130kg then do the bariatric surgery first."
  },
  {
    q: "I have diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases ,so I cannot undergo surgery?",
    a: "These conditions are no bar. Detail checkup is routine, and treated patients are better candidates for surgery. These diseases do not affect outcome but cautions needed. One can gain better health after surgery."
  },
  {
    q: "Is it like the kidney or liver replacement and my whole knee is removed and new put?",
    a: "No, whole knee is never replaced. Only worn-out part is removed and replaced by artificial ones. So technically it is more like resurfacing rather than replacement."
  },
  {
    q: "I will choose my implant from google?",
    a: "There are various designs and company of implants, many are good. Different surgeons use different company, so better to choose surgeon and leave it upon him to choose implant."
  },
  {
    q: "Expensive implants are always better. Only expensive implants give good results?",
    a: "There is reliable data to support that they are indeed superior. Indian and imported both are good but results don’t depend only on implants. Results depend on post operative care, physiotherapy and technique."
  },
  {
    q: "Computer navigation is of no use?",
    a: "There is evidence that computer navigation is marginally better than conventional for overall alignment."

  },
  {
    q: "HOW MUCH PAIN AM I GOING TO HAVE AFTER SURGERY?",
    a: "This is a common question, but one that is very difficult to answer. Every patient experiences pain differently. The same procedure may cause drastically different amounts of pain in different patients. Key components of controlling pain after surgery include icing the shoulder, taking appropriate pain medications, limiting activity appropriately, and following recommendations by the physical therapist. A nerve block is often placed by the anesthesia team during surgery. This block often works for several hours after surgery. As a result, your pain may be well controlled initially, but may increase after the block wears off. This is a normal part of the block wearing off, and shouldn’t be cause for concern in most cases. When you start to feel tingling in the arm, this is an indication that the block is beginning to wear off. This is a good time to begin taking pain medication."

Doctor recommends that you wear the sling at all times after surgery. You are encouraged to come out of the sling several times per day and move the elbow/hand/wrist to prevent them from becoming stiff. You may remove the sling to shower according to your post-op instruction sheet. The sling is a good reminder for you to be careful with the shoulder after surgery. It is also a signal to those around you to be careful, so it is especially important to wear your sling at work/school and in crowds. You will not be allowed to lift any significant weight (nothing more than 2-5 pounds) with the surgical arm for approximately 4-6 weeks after surgery. You may use the arm to perform some basic activities of daily living such as eating, hygiene and working at a computer."
