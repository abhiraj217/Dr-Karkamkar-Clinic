            <p>
            The shoulder joint is one of the most flexible and mobile joints in the human body. 
            It allows you to lift, rotate, push, pull, and perform a wide variety of daily activities 
            with ease. This mobility is possible because of the perfect coordination between bones, 
            muscles, tendons, and soft tissues.

            <h4 class="kneePartsTitle">Bones</h4>
            <p>Shoulder is made up of 4 joints:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Sternoclavicular (SC)</li>
            <li>Acromioclavicular (AC)</li>

            <li>Glenohumeral joint</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Together, these joints allow the shoulder to function as a highly adaptive unit, 
            enabling movements in almost every direction.

            </p>
            <p>
            Healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over each other with very little friction.

            <p>

            The rotator cuff is a group of muscles in the shoulder that allow a wide range 
            of movement while maintaining the stability of the glenohumeral joint:
            </p>

            <ul>

            </ul>

            <p>
            These muscles work together to lift the arm, rotate it, and keep the shoulder stable

          Shoulder pain is one of the most common complaints and can arise from 
          irritation, inflammation, degeneration, or injury to any of the structures 
          inside or around the joint. Because the shoulder is extremely mobile, it is 
          more vulnerable to soft tissue injuries and age-related changes.

          If your shoulder is severely damaged by arthritis, it may be hard for you 
          to perform simple activities such as lifting weights, wearing clothes, 
          making hair, or even taking a shower.
        </p>
        <p>
          If nonsurgical treatments like medications and supports are no longer helpful, 
          you may want to consider total shoulder replacement surgery. It is a safe and 
          effective procedure to relieve pain and help you resume normal activities.

        <p>
          The most common cause of chronic shoulder pain and disability is osteoarthritis.

          50 years and older.

          Aging decreases the ability of chondrocytes to maintain and restore articular

          cannot regenerate — making early diagnosis crucial.

            <h4 class="kneePartsTitle">What is Shoulder Arthroscopy?</h4>

            <p>
            Arthroscopy is a procedure that orthopaedic surgeons use to inspect, diagnose, 
            and repair problems inside a joint.
            </p>

            <p>
            The word <strong>arthroscopy</strong> comes from two Greek words — 
            "arthro" (joint) and "skopein" (to look).  
            The term literally means <strong>"to look within the joint."</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
            During shoulder arthroscopy, your surgeon inserts a small camera called an 
            <strong>arthroscope</strong> into your shoulder joint. The camera displays 
            pictures on a monitor, and your surgeon uses these real-time images to guide 
            miniature surgical instruments with extreme precision.
            </p>

            <p>
            Because the arthroscope and tools are very thin, your surgeon can perform the 
            entire procedure through tiny incisions (keyholes) instead of a large cut 
            needed for traditional open surgery.
            </p>

            <p>
            This results in:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Less postoperative pain</li>
            <li>Reduced soft-tissue damage</li>
            <li>Faster recovery</li>
            <li>Earlier return to daily activities and sports</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Shoulder arthroscopy is commonly used for conditions such as rotator cuff tears, 
            impingement, SLAP lesions, frozen shoulder release, and shoulder instability.
            </p>

            <h4 class="kneePartsTitle">Mini-Open Technique</h4>
            <p>
            On occasion, some parts of the surgery may be performed using the arthroscope, 
            while other parts may require a small <strong>mini-open incision</strong>.  
            This hybrid technique provides excellent visualization inside the joint while 
            still allowing strong repair of tissues like tendons.
            </p>

            <p>
            Your surgeon will recommend the best approach depending on the severity and type 
            of shoulder problem being treated.

            <h4 class="kneePartsTitle">When Shoulder Arthroscopy Is Recommended</h4>

            <p>
            Shoulder arthroscopy is recommended when pain or dysfunction does not respond 
            to medications, physiotherapy, injections, or rest. It is commonly advised when 
            structural problems inside the joint require repair, cleaning, or stabilization.
            </p>

            <p>Common arthroscopic procedures include:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Rotator cuff repair</li>
            <li>Repair of tendon tear</li>
            <li>Bone spur removal</li>
            <li>Removal or repair of the labrum</li>
            <li>Repair of ligaments</li>
            <li>Removal of inflamed tissue or loose cartilage</li>
            <li>Repair for recurrent shoulder dislocation</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="kneePartsTitle">Other Indications</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Frozen shoulder not responding to physiotherapy and medication</li>
            <li>Bursa / fat tissue excision</li>
            <li>Synovial biopsy</li>
            <li>Treatment of infection inside the joint</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Arthroscopy helps restore shoulder mobility, relieve pain, and prevent further 
            degeneration when conservative treatments fail.
